# adf-azsql-data-sync

**Azure Data Factory On-Prem SQL to Azure SQL Data Sync**

This project involves designing and implementing a data synchronization solution using **Azure Data Factory** (ADF) to transfer data from an **on-premises SQL Server** to **Azure SQL Database**. The primary goal is to ensure that data from the on-prem SQL environment is consistently synced with Azure SQL, enabling efficient cloud-based analytics and reporting. 

Key components include:
- **Azure Data Factory** for orchestration.
- **Self-hosted Integration Runtime** for secure data transfer.
- **Incremental Data Load** techniques to minimize transfer time and resources.
- **Error Handling and Monitoring** to ensure reliability and transparency.
